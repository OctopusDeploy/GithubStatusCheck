GitHub Status Checks

This is the glue between TeamCity and GitHub that allows us to run different chains based on what files we've committed (eg. Only run the frontend chain if you have changes only for the frontend) and still be able to use [GitHub Branch Protection Status Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
